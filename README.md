# rtl8365mb-kernel-hacking
A WIP repo for rtl8365mb kernel module hacking

Tested with Linux kernel 6.6.74 with Raspberry OS on a Raspberry Pi 5

Some unfinished code can be also found here: https://github.com/sipraga/linux/commits/alvin/rtl/offload-6.1.7/. I integrated some code into the branch [`alvin`](https://github.com/AlbrechtL/rtl8365mb-kernel-hacking/commits/alvin-code/). But the hardware forwarding is still not functioning.
